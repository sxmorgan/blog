<p>I’m Morgan, a second year computational biology / bioinformatics PhD student at the Experimental and Clinical Research Center in Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>My academic background consists of a BSc in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Purdue University (2015) and an MSc in Systems Biology from Heidelberg University (2018). Though my curiosity to learn the inner workings of the human body has most strongly influenced my career decisions, I have nurtured a joy for programming since I first took Java in high school and have recently taken to the field of data science. As a member of the <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.de/forslund">Forslund Lab</a> I feel lucky to satisfy many of my many interests.</p>
<p>In the next two years I hope to (1) benchmark and advance the statistical methods being widely deployed in microbiome research in order to (2) yield more robust biomarkers for complex disease phenotypes when exploring host-microbiome interactions from clinical collaborations.</p>
<p>Here is where I hope to digest and document some of what I’m learning for my research along the way, especially but not limited to statistical analysis in R.</p>
