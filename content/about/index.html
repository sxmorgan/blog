<p>I’m Morgan, a second year computational biology / bioinformatics PhD student at the Experimental and Clinical Research Center in Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>In the next two years I hope to (1) benchmark and advance the statistical methods being widely deployed in microbiome and multi-omics research in order to (2) yield more robust biomarkers when examining host-microbiome interactions from clinical collaborations.</p>
<p>Here is where I hope to digest and document some of what I’m learning for my research along the way, especially but not limited to statistical analysis in R.</p>
<p>You can check out some of my <a href="https://github.com/sxmorgan">code</a> on GitHub or my <a href="https://cargocollective.com/messex">photography</a> on Cargo.</p>
