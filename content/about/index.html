<p><strong>I’m Morgan,</strong> a second year systems biology / bioinformatics PhD student in the <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.de/forslund">Forslund Lab</a> at the Experimental and Clinical Research Center in Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>My academic background consists of a BSc in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Purdue University (2015) and a MSc in Systems Biology from Heidelberg University (2018). Though my curiosity to learn the inner workings of the human body has been the strongest influencer of my professional decisions, I have also nurtured a joy for programming since I first took Java in high school. The past year that has manifest as a deepened interest in data science.</p>
<p>In the next two years I hope to (1) benchmark and advance the statistical methods being widely deployed in microbiome research in order to (2) determine more robust biomarkers of disease phenotypes when exploring host-microbiome interactions from clinical collaborations. I do plan to elaborate on this here for different audiences, but for now please check out the lab homepage to contextualize my work.</p>
<p>I built this site as a place to digest and document some of what I’m learning from and for my research along the way, especially statistical analysis in the R programming language and insight into the gut microbiome.</p>
