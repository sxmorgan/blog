I'm Morgan, a second year computational biology / bioinformatics PhD student at the Experimental and Clinical Research Center in Berlin, Germany. 

In the next two years I hope to (1) benchmark and advance the statistical methods being widely deployed in microbiome and multi-omics research in order to (2) yield more robust biomarkers when examining host-microbiome interactions from clinical collaborations.

Here is where I hope to digest and document some of what I'm learning for my research along the way, especially but not limited to statistical analysis in R. 

You can check out some of my [code](https://github.com/sxmorgan) on GitHub or my [photography](https://cargocollective.com/messex) on Cargo.
