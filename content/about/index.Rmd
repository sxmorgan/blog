**I'm Morgan,** a second year systems biology / bioinformatics PhD student in the [Forslund Lab](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/forslund) at the Experimental and Clinical Research Center in Berlin, Germany.

My academic background consists of a BSc in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Purdue University (2015) and a MSc in Systems Biology from Heidelberg University (2018). Though my curiosity to learn the inner workings of the human body has been the strongest influence of my career decisions, I have nurtured a joy for programming since I first took Java in high school. The past year that has manifest as a deepened interest in data science.  

In the next two years I hope to (1) benchmark and advance the statistical methods being widely deployed in microbiome research in order to (2) yield more robust biomarkers for complex disease phenotypes when exploring host-microbiome interactions from clinical collaborations. I do hope to elaborate on this here for different audiences, but for now please check out the lab homepage for more context on my work. 

I built this site as a place to digest and document some of what I'm learning for my research along the way, especially but not limited to statistical analysis in the R programming language. 

You can check out some of my [code](https://github.com/sxmorgan) on GitHub, my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bZuOHS8AAAAJ&hl=en) on Google Scholar, or my [photography](https://cargocollective.com/messex) on Cargo.

This website was created using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package in RStudio.
