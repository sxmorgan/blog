**I'm Morgan,** a third year computational medical science PhD student in the [Forslund Lab](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/forslund) at the Experimental and Clinical Research Center in Berlin, Germany.

My academic background consists of a BSc in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Purdue University (2015) and a MSc in Systems Biology from Heidelberg University (2018). Though my curiosity to learn the inner workings of the human body has had the strongest influence on my professional decisions, I have nurtured a joy for programming since I first took Java in high school. The past few years, that has manifest as a deepened interest in data science.  

I built this site during the initial lockdown of 2020 as a place to digest and document what I was learning at the time, as a resource for my colleagues and future students in my shoes, and as a reminder to myself that I can learn and do almost anything I set my mind to. Then I got tunnel vision during my PhD. 

The name of this site, **("data _and_ science")**, references the two components of the ultimate system of inquiry: empirical analysis. Data without science is overwhelming, and the spirit of science is a never-ending search to connect the right data.

This website was created with the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package in RStudio using the [**console theme**](https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console/).
