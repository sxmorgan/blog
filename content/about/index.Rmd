**I'm Morgan,** a third year computational medical science PhD student in the [Forslund Lab](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/forslund) at the Experimental and Clinical Research Center in Berlin, Germany.

My academic background consists of a BSc in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Purdue University (2015) and a MSc in Systems Biology from Heidelberg University (2018). Though my curiosity to learn the inner workings of the human body has had the strongest influence on my professional decisions, I have nurtured a joy for programming since I first took Java in high school. The past year that has manifest as a deepened interest in data science.  

In the next two years I hope to (1) benchmark and advance the statistical methods being widely deployed in microbiome research in order to (2) determine more robust biomarkers of disease when exploring host-microbiome interactions from clinical collaborations. I plan to elaborate on this here for different audiences, but for now please check out the lab homepage to contextualize my work. 

I built this site as a place to digest and document what I'm learning along the way, and as a resource for my colleagues. The name **("data _and_ science")** expresses my fondness of semantics as well as my intent to explore not only technical topics like statistical analysis and programming in R (data), but also the resulting biological insight such analyses yield into the human microbiome (science). I feel these are slightly separate endeavors despite their dependence and overlap.

This website was created with the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package in RStudio using the [**console theme**](https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console/).
