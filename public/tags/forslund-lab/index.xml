      <description>The tidyverse is a set of actively developed and well-maintained R packages to facilitate the typical data analysis workflow. Most but not all of the core tidyverse packages (there are now 8) were designed by Hadley Wickham, chief scientist at R Studio since 2013. He&amp;rsquo;s written a book, &lt;em&gt;R for Data Science&lt;/em&gt;, which is an incredible resource for all programming levels, and given plenty of conceptual talks which are of course available on YouTube.</description>
