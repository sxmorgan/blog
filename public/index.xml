      <description>img { border-radius: 50%; width: 20em; }  Iâ€™m Morgan, a second year computational biology / bioinformatics PhD student at the Experimental and Clinical Research Center in Berlin, Germany.
My academic background consists of a BSc in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Purdue University (2015) and an MSc in Systems Biology from Heidelberg University (2018). Though my curiosity to learn the inner workings of the human body has most strongly influenced my career decisions, I have nurtured a joy for programming since I first took Java in high school and have recently taken to the field of data science.</description>
