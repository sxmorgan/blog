Most but not all of the core tidyverse packages (there are now 8) were designed by Hadley Wickham, chief scientist at R Studio since 2013. He’s written a book, R for Data Science, which is an incredible resource for all programming levels, and given several talks which are of course available on YouTube if you find yourself becoming curious too…</description>

In the next two years I hope to (1) benchmark and advance the statistical methods being widely deployed in microbiome and multi-omics research in order to (2) better illuminate robust and covariate-aware host-microbiome interactions through various clinical collaborations.
Here is where I hope to digest and document some of what I&amp;rsquo;m learning for my research along the way, especially but not limited to statistical analysis in R.</description>
