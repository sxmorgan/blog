<p><strong>I’m Morgan,</strong> a second year systems biology / bioinformatics PhD student in the <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.de/forslund">Forslund Lab</a> at the Experimental and Clinical Research Center in Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>My academic background consists of a BSc in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Purdue University (2015) and a MSc in Systems Biology from Heidelberg University (2018). Though my curiosity to learn the inner workings of the human body has had the strongest influence on my professional decisions, I have nurtured a joy for programming since I first took Java in high school. The past year that has manifest as a deepened interest in data science.</p>
<p>In the next two years I hope to (1) benchmark and advance the statistical methods being widely deployed in microbiome research in order to (2) determine more robust biomarkers of disease when exploring host-microbiome interactions from clinical collaborations. I plan to elaborate on this here for different audiences, but for now please check out the lab homepage to contextualize my work.</p>
<p>I built this site as a place to digest and document what I’m learning along the way, and as a resource for my colleagues. The name <strong>(“data <em>and</em> science”)</strong> expresses my fondness of semantics as well as my intent to explore not only technical topics like statistical analysis and programming in R (data), but also the resulting biological insight such analyses yield into the human microbiome (science). I feel these are slightly separate endeavors despite their dependence and overlap.</p>
