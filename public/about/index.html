<h3>I’m Morgan</h3>
<p>a second year computational biology / bioinformatics PhD student at the Experimental and Clinical Research Center in Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>In the next two years I hope to (1) benchmark and advance the statistical methods being widely deployed in microbiome and multi-omics research in order to (2) better illuminate robust and covariate-aware host-microbiome interactions through various clinical collaborations.</p>
<p>This website is where I hope to digest and document some of what I’m learning for my research along the way, especially but not limited to statistical analysis in R. I have a passion for optimization and organization that I’m grateful to be able to nurture as part of my job.</p>
<p>This website was created using the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown"><strong>blogdown</strong></a> package.</p>
